chapter 5 eliminating toil

toil definition
* Manual: stuff done by hand, including manually running a script
* Repetitive: if it was done more than twice
* Automatable: if the human participation in the task in not needed
* Tactical: interrupt-drive and reactive
* No Enduring Value: if service remains in the same state as before
* O(n) with service growth: if work on the task scales linearly

How to manage toil: 50% time spent on engineering work to reduce toil, and the other 50% on operational work (i.e. toil).

Typical SRE activities
